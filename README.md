## Agile Methodology
Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com)


The 5 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Database Schema 

Two relational databases were used to create this site - during production SQLite was used and then Postgres was used for the deployed Heroku version. Below is an image of how the database models relate to each other:

üîê Security Features and Defensive Design

At IronQueens, the security of our users and the integrity of the platform are top priorities. Below are the core security measures and defensive design strategies integrated into the project:
üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è User Authentication and Authorization

Class-Based Views (CBVs):
    Utilized LoginRequiredMixin to restrict access to authenticated users only.
    Implemented UserPassesTestMixin to enforce object-level permissions, allowing users to edit or delete only their own content unless they are superusers.

Function-Based Views (FBVs):
Applied @login_required and @user_passes_test decorators to protect sensitive views and enforce role-based access.

üìù Form Validation

  All forms have server-side validation to prevent invalid or malicious data submission.

  Clear error messages inform users of the exact field that caused validation to fail.

  Input fields are sanitized and validated to defend against injection and formatting errors.

üóÑÔ∏è Database Security

  Sensitive configuration variables like the database URL, Django secret key, and third-party API credentials (e.g., Stripe) are securely stored in env.py, keeping them out of source control.

  Parameterized queries and ORM-based database interaction prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

üõ°Ô∏è CSRF Protection and Session Management

  All forms across the platform include Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens provided by Django.

  Secure session management practices are used, including secure cookie flags and session expiry settings to minimize session hijacking risk.

‚ùå Custom Error Pages

To improve user experience and clarity during error states, custom error pages were implemented:

400 ‚Äì Bad Request: IronQueens couldn‚Äôt process your request. Please try again.

403 ‚Äì Forbidden: You don‚Äôt have permission to view this page. Try logging into the correct account.

404 ‚Äì Page Not Found: The page you‚Äôre looking for may have moved or no longer exists.

500 ‚Äì Server Error: A problem occurred on our end. We‚Äôre working to fix it promptly.
