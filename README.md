## Agile Methodology
Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/ci-sumi/projects/4)


The 5 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Database Schema 

Two relational databases were used to create this site - during production SQLite was used and then Postgres was used for the deployed Heroku version. Below is an image of how the database models relate to each other:

![Database Schema](docs/readme_images/database.png)

üîê Security Features and Defensive Design

At IronQueens, the security of our users and the integrity of the platform are top priorities. Below are the core security measures and defensive design strategies integrated into the project:
üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è User Authentication and Authorization

Class-Based Views (CBVs):
    Utilized LoginRequiredMixin to restrict access to authenticated users only.
    Implemented UserPassesTestMixin to enforce object-level permissions, allowing users to edit or delete only their own content unless they are superusers.

Function-Based Views (FBVs):
Applied @login_required and @user_passes_test decorators to protect sensitive views and enforce role-based access.

üìù Form Validation

  All forms have server-side validation to prevent invalid or malicious data submission.

  Clear error messages inform users of the exact field that caused validation to fail.

  Input fields are sanitized and validated to defend against injection and formatting errors.

üóÑÔ∏è Database Security

  Sensitive configuration variables like the database URL, Django secret key, and third-party API credentials (e.g., Stripe) are securely stored in env.py, keeping them out of source control.

  Parameterized queries and ORM-based database interaction prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

üõ°Ô∏è CSRF Protection and Session Management

  All forms across the platform include Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens provided by Django.

  Secure session management practices are used, including secure cookie flags and session expiry settings to minimize session hijacking risk.

‚ùå Custom Error Pages

To improve user experience and clarity during error states, custom error pages were implemented:


404 ‚Äì Page Not Found: The page you‚Äôre looking for may have moved or no longer exists.

In order to build brand trust, a testimonial page for interior design services has been included in the site with a link to the page being included in the page footer as well as the main nav bar. 

The page footer also includes links to the privacy policy to inform users about how their data is being collected and processed.

**Sitemap and robots.txt**

A sitemap file with a list of important page URLs was created to ensure that search engines are able to understand the site's structure and easily navigate through the site. This was made using xml-sitemaps.com.

A robots.txt file was created to tell search engines where they are not allowed to go on the website. This improves SEO by increasing the quality of the site

### Content marketing 
The site showcases high quality images of previous interior design projects projects in order to attract potential new clients. The photos allow the business to show off their expertise and style and build up trust with the customer.

### Social Media Marketing 
For this site, a Facebook business page has been created for organic social media marketing. The Facebook page includes a 'Shop Now' button which takes the user to the Fresh Nest website. The page pairs well with the content media marketing on the main site as images of previous projects and new product arrivals can be shared easily.
Facebook now prioritizes Facebook Shops (hosted by Meta), especially in the New Pages Experience. That‚Äôs why you're only seeing:

    ‚ÄúShop on Facebook‚Äù

    ‚ÄúConnect another tool‚Äù (e.g. Shopify, BigCommerce, etc.)

Unfortunately, they‚Äôve removed the ability to link external stores directly from the ‚ÄúShop Now‚Äù button in some regions and accounts.
## üì≤ Facebook Page Integration

To link the live store to your Facebook Business Page:

1. Facebook currently does **not support external links** with the **‚ÄúShop Now‚Äù** button directly.
2. Instead, use the **‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù** button as a workaround:
   - Go to your Facebook Business Page.
   - Click the **Edit Action Button** below your cover photo.
   - Select **‚ÄúLearn More‚Äù**.
   - Choose **‚ÄúLink to Website‚Äù** and enter:  
     `https://iron-queens-9a116e72c4d2.herokuapp.com/`
3. Save and test the button ‚Äî it will redirect users to the live Iron Queens store.

### Email Marketing
Visitors to the site can sign up to the newsletter and do not need to have an account to do so. A signup box is included in the footer of the site. This allows the business to share news with customers and potential customers including new products/services and special offers. Mailchimp was used to create this service. 

## Testing
Testing and results can be found [here](/TESTING.md)

## Deployment - Heroku

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

### Create the Heroku App:
- Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) or create an account.
- On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Enter a unique and meaningful app name.
- Next, select your region.
- Click on the Create App button.

### Attach the Postgres database:
- In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.

- Go back to your IDE and install 2 more requirements:
    - `pip3 install dj_databse_url`
    - `pip3 install psycopg2-binary` 
- Create requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file. 
- In settings.py file import dj_database_url, comment out the default configurations within database settings and add the following: 

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
```
- Run migrations and create a superuser for the new database. 
- Create an if statement in settings.py to run the postgres database when using the app on heroku or sqlite if not

```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
            }
    }
```

- Create requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following: `web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi:application`
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list in settings.py in the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

- Push these changes to Github.

### Update Heroku Config Vars

### Connecting S3 to Django 
- Go back to your IDE and install 2 more requirements:
    - `pip3 install boto3`
    - `pip3 install django-storages` 
- Update your requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` and add storages to your installed apps.
- Create an if statement in settings.py 

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-your-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')

```
- Then add the line 

    - `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'` to tell django where our static files will be coming from in production.


- Create a file called custom storages and import both our settings from django.con as well as the s3boto3 storage class from django storages. 
- Create the following classes:

```
class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

- In settings.py add the following inside the if statement:

```
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

```

- and then add the following at the top of the if statement:
```
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```

- Go to S3, go to your bucket and click 'Create folder'. Name the folder 'media' and click 'Save'.
- Inside the folder, click 'Upload', 'Add files', and then select all the images that you are using for your site.
- Then under 'Permissions' select the option 'Grant public-read access' and click upload.
- Your static files and media files should be automatically linked from django to your S3 bucket.
